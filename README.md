Sparse Matrix Operations
Overview
This project implements a Sparse Matrix class in Python that supports basic matrix operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition. The implementation is optimized for handling large matrices where most elements are zero.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Installation
Clone the repository
Navigate to the project directory:
cd dsa/sparse_matrix/code/src
Usage
Run the main script:

python sparse_matrix.py
The program will:

Display a menu of available operations
Load sample matrices from the sample_inputs directory
Perform the selected operation
Save the result to the sample_result directory
Available Operations
SUM: Matrix Addition
DIFF: Matrix Subtraction
PROD: Matrix Multiplication
Sample Input Format
Matrix files should follow this format:

rows=3
cols=3
(0, 0, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(2, 2, 3)
