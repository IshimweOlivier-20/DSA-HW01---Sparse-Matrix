# Sparse Matrix Operations 🧮

## Overview

This project implements a **Sparse Matrix** class in Python that supports basic matrix operations, including:

- Addition ➕
- Subtraction ➖
- Multiplication ✖️
- Transposition 🔄

The implementation is optimized for handling large matrices where most elements are zero, making it efficient for memory and performance.
